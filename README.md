# website

This is my first website. It has some issues I know, and it took me waaay too long to finish it.
Wasn't sure if you needed all the comments so I only included a couple. 
You can find a HOME page, a PORTFOLIO page and a page ABOUT ME a litte.
Not the best but for now it will do. THANK YOU FULLSTACK ACADEMY for the great opportunity.
Also I forgot to check off the task's as I was going. BUt will remember to mark them as "DONE".
Can't wait to see the grade.
