            •Administrator for scheduling and payroll.
        <p> •Monitoring trailer temperature and drawer ventilation to improve chicken livability upon arrival of
            230,000 birds monitored with 44 loads from 5.5 growers that are scheduled daily.</p>
        <p>•Applied more efficient techniques to the trailer loading/unloading process at the plant, which
            saves
            each
            driver up to 5 hours per week.</p> The saved time is used by the drivers to do a better
        pre/post-trip
        inspection
        and they report issues on the equipment before they became a severe mechanical failure.</p>
        <p> •Made a scheduling tool for easier and more proficient scheduling of the 26 drivers that I
            supervise.Saving an average of 1.7 hours per week, create the perfect depart time to the truck
            drivers to
            minimize
            downtime
            between loads.</p>
        <p>•Simplified the onboarding process for new team members and made it more efficient by cutting 3
            hours of
            training.
        <p>Also made the onboarding more user-friendly for the non-native English speakers.</p>
        <p>•Maintain a Zero Injury environment. In the year of 2018/2019, we had 0 injuries. Last year alone I
            created 25 safety SOP’s to protect my employees.</p>
        <p>•Created an interactive news board to improve communication between the managers and drivers.</p>
        <p>•The drivers met the requirements for the monthly bonus every month so far.</p>
        <p>•Managed to lower new driver training time and from 3 to 2 week, while maximizing the success of the
            course.</p>
        <p>•With new time calculation formula can calculate the driver’s work time in advance, and minimize
            overtime.</p>
        <p>•Minimized wear and tear on equipment with adapted loading procedures, and Go No Go trailer brake
            gauges.</p>
        <p>•Coaching methods helped to improve equipment depart time and with that, we shortened overall load
            out-time.</p>
        <p>•Improved Operational Excellence standards (6S) in our department with weekly audits from 61% to
            92%.</p>
        <p>•Increased the monthly training success rate from 80% to 100% at the live haul for the drivers and
            mechanics.
