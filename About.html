        <p id="About_Me">
            My interest are: Cycling, And I am passionate about photography. I enjoy spending time with my family
            who still
            lives in Serbia and Hungary. With that comes a lot of traveling. Since I grew up on a farm, taking care
            of
            animals is something I had to deal with on a daily basis. Milking my goats early morning and at night.
            During
            calving season helping the cattle, and even helping hogs to deliver their little piglets. All this was
            very
            helpful when I vent to learn how to be a Veterinarian technician.
